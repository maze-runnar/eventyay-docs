<p><a href="https://eventyay.com">eventyay.com</a> is the hosted service of the <a href="https://github.com/fossasia?q=open-event">Open Event</a> application developed by <a href="https://fossasia.org">FOSSASIA</a> in cooperation with a global community.</p>

<p>The project started 2015 and was used for many years as an event management system for the annual <a href="https://summit.fossasia.org">FOSSASIA Summit</a>, OpenTechSummits and meetups. Since 2019 the platform can be used as a hosted solution by event organizers.</p>

<p>Most of the code contributions have been done by hundreds of community developers, but FOSSASIA also employs a team of developers who maintain the system, review pull requests and define the roadmap of the project.</p>

<p>There are a number of repositories ranging from the frontend, to backend, Android apps for attendees and organizers as well as iOS apps (attendee/organizers).</p>

<p>To learn more about developers you can always visit the tab “insights” on one of the repositories and choose “contributors” on the menu tab, e.g on the <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-frontend/graphs/contributors">frontend repo</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/fossasia/open-event-server/graphs/contributors">server repository</a>.</p>
